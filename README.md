# The-Occident-Express

The Occident Express, the not-so-famous counterpart to the super-duper-famous Orient 
Express, makes its way through Western Europe once again. On board: important people 
with important destinations. And potentially deadly cargo. 
Unaware of what awaits him on this journey there is Bob, an almost-retired security guard, 
whose main goal in life is to finally reach retirement and spend the rest of his days on some 
island in the Caribbean Sea. Until then, he has to make it through his last couple of shifts as 
a security guard on the luxurious Occident Express. Since Bob is not a very approachable 
guy, he mostly keeps to himself during those shifts, dozing off in a comfy seat next to the 
dining compartment of the train with a coffee and some donuts at hand. Since nothing ever 
happens on a train like this anyway, his security guard duties are kept within limits. At least 
until this unlikely hero needs to save the day. 

## 1. Game Description

### 1.1 Overview

“The Occident Express” is a narrative-focused 2D detective game set on a train. The 
almost-retired and less-than-motivated security guard Bob is taking a little in-the-middle-of
work nap when his walkie-talkie wakes him with shocking news: There is a bomb on the 
train. And Bob needs to find it discreetly within the next 15 minutes if he doesn’t want to 
spend his well-earned pension in heaven. To find the bomb in time, Bob has to move through the train, talk to the other 
passengers, and look for hidden hints that will lead him to the bomb. 

### 1.1 Objectives to be achieved by the game 

The game invites the player to prevent the train from exploding by using their powers of 
deduction and ingenuity. Funny dialogs and hand-drawn assets are intended to create an 
engaging atmosphere and encourage the player to get involved in the puzzle and generate 
empathy with Bob and the other passengers. 

### 1.2 Core gameplay 

The main activity of the player is to explore the train as Bob and talk to the other 
passengers. What makes this game fun is its narrative component. While moving through the train 
as grumpy old Bob, the player will engage in conversations with the passengers. 
Each of them will have their own little story to tell as well as fun personality traits that will show in the conversations. Additionally, Bob will be talking to his 
walkie-talkie and the person behind it a lot, complaining about his job and this whole bomb 
situation. The game aims to make the player sympathize with Bob and snicker about his 
sassy comments. The conversations with the passengers will contribute to this as well while 
at the same time providing important clues that will help the player find the bomb and help 
Bob save the day.
